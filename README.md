# Machine Learning with Python: K Means Clustering
K Means clustering is a popular machine learning algorithm used for grouping data points into distinct clusters based on their similarities. This powerful technique is widely used in various fields such as finance, marketing, biology and many more. K Means clustering is an unsupervised learning algorithm which means it doesnâ€™t require the input data to be labelled or pre-assigned with predefined output classes. Instead, it tries to partition the dataset into groups with minimal intra-cluster variance and maximum inter-cluster distance.
